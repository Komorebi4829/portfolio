Welcome to my website! 

ðŸ‘‹ **I'm Kent River**, a self-taught full-stack developer who enjoys creating smooth, user-friendly digital experiences. My programming journey started with Python backend development and creating crawlers, and later I transitioned to frontend development due to some opportunities. Over the past six years, I've delved deep into it. Especially during the Covid-19, I was the main frontend maintainer for a province-level nucleic acid testing mini-program, which was a challenging yet fulfilling experience.

I have three years of backend experience and six years of frontend experience, covering all aspects of web development. I take pride in simplifying complex problems and creating user-friendly solutions. Currently, I'm a TS full-stack developer, skilled in using NestJS for backend development and applying Next.js/React.js in frontend technologies. I also continue to use Python for backend development, excelling in Django and FastAPI.

My goal is to become an independent developer, creating my own projects and contributing to the open-source community. This path allows me to explore my creativity and bring value to the tech world.

Beyond coding, I enjoy playing video games, badminton, and reading books, especially Minesweeper, which is my way to relax and improve problem-solving skills.

I'm always eager to connect with other developers, exchange ideas, discuss new technologies, or collaborate on creative projects. If you have any questions or want to discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to contact me. I believe that effective communication and teamwork are key to success.

Currently, I'm looking for new project opportunities, excited to apply my diverse skills with talented individuals or teams. Whether it's building a full-stack application from scratch or enhancing an existing project, I'm ready to take on the challenge.

If you have project needs or want to discuss collaboration possibilities, please contact me anytime. I'm always open to new challenges and growth opportunities.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!
